I hope that it will work *properly*

# What am I going to do?  
Well for example I could put a [**link**](https://animenosekai.herokuapp.com/status)[^1]  
This is an inline code: `pip install markdown-creation`  
## Let me test code blocks  
```json
{
    "key": "value",
    "details": "this is a test of the code block"
}
```  
I think that I will print out the table of content with newMD.tableOfContent(2)  
And I'll maybe try to output an html file
